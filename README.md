1.Ten students (s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8,s9,s10) are going to attend an event. There are lots of gift shops, they all are going to the gift shops and randomly picking the gifts. After picking the gifts they are randomly arriving in the billing counter. The accountant gives the preference to that student who has maximum number of gifts. Create a C program to define order of billed students? 
File Name for the 1st program was saved as:STUD
2.Write a program in C which reads input CPU bursts from a the first line of a text file named as CPU_BURST.txt. Validate the input numbers whether the numbers are positive intergers or not. Consider the numbers as CPU burst.If there are 5 positive integers in the first line of the text file then the program treat those argument as required CPU bust for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 process and calculate average waiting time and average turn around time. Consider used scheduling algorithm as SJF and same arrival time for all the processe2.
